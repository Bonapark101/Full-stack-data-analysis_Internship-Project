Spot coffee sales performance analysis

# Executive summary
The company is growing its client base and increasing the number of spot lots available. Using Python and Tableau, I pulled sales and lot attributes data to create a dashboard to inspect the sales and market trends throughout 2023 - 2025. I identified that the largest revenue oppportunities are to increase spot coffee lots having 'Nutty/Cocoa' and 'Nutty/Cocoa + Fruity' flavour. Additionally, I researched that these profiles match how consumer shift toward iced and cold coffee drinks in hot weather, where smooth chocolatey and fruity notes work especially well in lattes, coldb brew, and seasonal limited-time drinks.

I linked the finding to the market trend and consumer behaviour to recommended the company to:
1) Source more coffees with Nutty/Cocoa and Nutty/Cocoa + Fruity flavour
2) Increase the share of those flavour profiles in the company's summer spot offers. 

# Business Problem
The quality of green coffee beans degrade over time. When spot coffee lots sell slowly or at discounts, overall business performance and profitability drop. How can we reduce holding cost and maximize profit for spot coffees?

# Methodology
1. Data cleaning, standardizing, and transforming in Python
2. A dashboard in Tableau that shows the trends in sales and lot attributes

# Skills
Python: pdf plumber, pandas, pathlib, numpy, re
Tableau: establish relationships, writing functions, data visualization 

# Result & Recommendation
This analysis showed that spot coffee revenue peaks in June/July, with 173% client growth from 2023 to 2025. Lot attributes reveal Brazil/Natural/Blend dominate velocity for aggressive scaling, Colombia/Anaerobic honey/Castillo variants lead margins (180-221%, for profit focus), while Vietnam and Guatemala underperform. Brazial/Natural/Blend and Colombia/Anaerobic honey/Castillo variants are highly aligned with Nutth/Cocoa flavour profiles. Additionally, Nutty/Cocoa flavour + SCA 83 - 85 maximize commercial velocity.

Recommendation: Rebalancing sourcing based on the finding to reduce holding costs and boost profitability.

*Because the company operates pre-order coffee and spot coffee, further anlaysis is required on overall lot sales performance across both channels to confirm strategy applicability

# Next Steps
1. Research and analyze about regional market and clients
2. Analyze pre-order coffee sales performance
